You don't need to look at this! It simulates experimental data that we can practise with!

# Excersise 1

```{r}
mean_control=15000
mean_treated=12000
sd_both=1000

cell_treatment_data<-data.frame(Group=c(rep("Control",3),rep("Treated",3)),
                                Metabolic_Activity=c(rnorm(3,mean_control,sd_both),rnorm(3,mean_treated,sd_both)))

cell_treatment_data %<>% transmute(Metabolic_Activity=round(Metabolic_Activity))

write_csv(cell_treatment_data,"cell_treatment_data.csv")
```
